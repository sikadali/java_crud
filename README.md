# A simple Java-built CRUD application
The objective here is to build an app which has a CRUD database. This is about building a music database : ID, Song, Artist, Genre, Year, and maybe a Spotify link.

I worked with JavaFX for the GUI and on NetBeans IDE, and used mysql_connector and phpMyAdmin to manage connection to the database.
